## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Code Formatting for Google Docs**: Code blocks now display with visual `‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê CODE (LANGUAGE) ‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê` headers and indentation for better readability
- **Inline Code Markers**: Inline code wrapped with `‚ü® ‚ü©` angle brackets for visibility in Google Docs
- **Smart Caching System**: MD5 hash-based caching to skip unchanged files (20-30x faster on subsequent syncs!)
- **Code File Support**: Added support for .php, .py, .js, .ts, .tsx, .jsx, .json, .yml, .yaml files
- **Named Docker Volume**: Cross-platform cache persistence using Docker-managed volumes (works on Windows, Mac, Linux)
- **Cache Statistics**: Track synced vs skipped files with detailed reporting (e.g., "Synced: 2 files, Skipped: 39 files")
- **SyncCache class**: New caching module with MD5 hashing, cache persistence, and change detection
- **Update instead of duplicate**: Files and folders are now updated if they already exist, preventing duplicates
- `get_or_create_folder()` method that checks for existing folders before creating new ones
- Support for Google Workspace Shared Drives with `supportsAllDrives=True` parameter
- Visual feedback showing whether files were created (‚úÖ Created) or updated (üîÑ Updated)
- Better folder reuse across multiple sync runs

### Changed
- Markdown converter now preprocesses content before upload for better code display in Google Docs
- Sync system reports detailed sync/skip statistics at end of each run
- Docker compose includes persistent cache volume configuration
- `markdown_to_doc()` now updates existing Google Docs instead of creating duplicates
- `csv_to_sheet()` now updates existing Google Sheets instead of creating duplicates
- `create_folder()` is now a wrapper around `get_or_create_folder()` for backward compatibility
- Simplified markdown conversion: direct upload with mimeType conversion instead of upload-copy-delete workflow
- All Google Drive API calls now include `supportsAllDrives=True` for Shared Drive compatibility

### Performance
- **20-30x faster** on subsequent syncs with unchanged files
- Only modified files are re-uploaded (detected via MD5 hash)
- Cache persists across container restarts using Docker named volumes

### Fixed
- Duplicate files created on subsequent syncs
- Duplicate folders created on subsequent syncs
- Files not syncing to Google Workspace Shared Drives
- Unnecessary temporary file creation during markdown conversion
- Docker permission issues across different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Temp file cleanup after uploads
